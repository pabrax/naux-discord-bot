"""
Placeholder module for automation/orchestrator integration (n8n, webhooks, runners, etc).

This file is intentionally left as a stub per project guidelines. Implementations that
should live here include:

- high-level Action Router that accepts named actions and maps them to handlers
- secure executor for local scripts (with whitelist, audit logging and timeouts)
- webhook clients / n8n triggers wrappers
- adapters to queue and monitor long-running tasks

Keep this file as the design entrypoint and do NOT add execution code here until the
security model and permission checks are defined.

# TODO: Implement Action Router and safe execution helpers here.
